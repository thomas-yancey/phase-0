##Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Creating a repository on Github is easy once you have your account set up. You just need to follow these steps
 - Go to the + sign in the top right corner of the page when logged into your profile
 - Select create new repository
 - Fill out the form that is presented, select a name for your repository using this-naming-convention. select any licenses you would like to use and whether or not the repo will be public or private(private requires paying for the service)
 - Once you have created the repository, make a clone of it to your local computer.
 - Copy the git url found just above the file listing
 - Open your terminal if using a mac. you can do this by using spotlight and searching and selecting terminal
 - go into a directory you want to clone the repo into, you can navigate through directories using the cd command. check your current directory using pwd
 - when you are in the directory you want the clone to be in, simply type "git clone " and then paste in the URL you have copied.
##Describe what open source means.
Open Source means that whatever you have created you wish to share freely and allow others to use as they wish. As related to software it allows others to use your code in their own projects, or allows them to modify it however they wish.

##What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
As far as I can tell the prevelance of Open Source software will be a huge tool in learning how to code. It allows an opportunity to look at complex applications and see how they work. It this stage it obviously does not make me nervous, but down the road if I created something I found valuable, I may be hesitant to just allow anyone to use it. I see how it could be viewed as a utopia, I think it is pretty admirable that so many people are willing to in a sense give away a lot of their extensive work.

##Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are very important in 1. protecting yourself, and 2. Letting others know what can and cannot be done with your work. If you take the time to select the appropriate license, you can rest assured that you and your work is protected in the manner you want it to be.

##What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
In this challenge I became much more confident in my git skills. I started to see how it comes together and how the commands we have learned are not as intimidating as I found them in the previous challenge.

##Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
In this lesson I stuck with only the resources provided.
