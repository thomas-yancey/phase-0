###1.1 Think About Time Reflection

In going through this lesson I learned about various time management techniques. The two that were most intriguing to me were the Pomodoro technique and the article on counter-intuitive productivity. The tip on giving yourself less time stands out to be me as highly valuable in that I find I can work better in smaller time frames, framing more activities in that way could lead to greater productivity. The Pomodoro technique works into that by giving me a way to measure activity in short focused bursts. Time boxing can be viewed as the overall idea encapsulated in the Pomodoro technique, that is work on a specific task in a short designated time frame and then reflect on what you accomplished in that time. Currently I manage time by using lists which produce mixed results for me, sometimes it helps me focus and other times it pushes me to procrastinate. Coming into Phase 0 I plan on employing a few of the techniques listed. First the Pomodoro technique which will enable me to gauge my pace and understanding. Second I want to keep in focus what the learn ruby the hard way intro highlighted, which is not to get frustrated with the difficult tasks and to just keep at them. As covered in week 0 I think embracing confusion will be important in not becoming bogged down in new and difficult material.

###1,2 The Command Line Reflection

As I understand it a shell is any command line interpreter that interfaces with The operating system (the GUI finder on mac is considered a shell) . Bash is the command line interpreter that is refered to as the terminal, it is a CLI with no graphical user interface.
The most challenging portion of the material was the introductory video for me. I tried to follow along on my own terminal and quickly learned my skills were not sufficient to follow along in real time. It was a lot of information that was easy to get lost in, but working my way through it helped in getting through the command line crash course.
At this point I believe the most important commands to know are all the basics related to file management and movement (mkdir, cd, ls, pwd, mv and cp ). The most rewarding command though was probably grep, though in getting through the course not as necessary.
Here is my attempt to get through the commands off the top of my head
- pwd print working directory (prints the full directory of your current location)
- ls lists all contents of a directory
- mv moves a file and can rename, can go across directorys syntax is mv file.txt newname.txt
- cd change directory
- ../ moves up one directory from current position
- touch creates a new file ex. touch newfile.txt
- mkdir makes new directory ex. mkdir directoryname
- less allows you to go through text of file page by page
- rmdir removes or deletes a directory
- rm removes or deletes a file
- help - this one I had to run to find out - it appears to list alot of available bash functions and can be used for more info.

###1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
steps to creating a new repo
- log into your github account
- click the + icon in the top right corner of the page and select new repository
- fill out the required and select your customizations
- when naming your repository use a naming convention of first-second-third
steps to fork a repository
- make sure you are logged into your Github account
- go to the desired repo you want to fork
- click the fork button in the top right corner of the page under your profile icon
steps for cloning a repository
- go to the repository you would like to clone
- copy the git path that is in the HTTPS box above the repository contents
- open your terminal and cd into the directory you would like to make the clone
- type “git clone” and than paste the git path you had just copied
- you may have to enter a password for your Github account

in setting up git and Github in this lesson I did not struggle too much. The setup came off as pretty straight forward. The portion I struggled with the most was the diagram early on in the video. conceptually it was difficult to wrap my head around the different stages of the branches but I hope to understand with practice.
